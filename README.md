# Flask-Sample-App
Sample for a Flask application with directories to use as starting point. In order to run the application, navigate to the folder where the file app.py is located and enter:
```
python app.py
```

You will then be able to access the application in a browser (Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer etc.) by entering the URL: 
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```
From here you can learn more in the official Flask documentation, the numerous tutorials and also continue with more advanced html,css and javascript to adjust accoridng to your preffered style. Have fun!
